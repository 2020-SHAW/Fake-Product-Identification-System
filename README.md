# Fake Product Identification System

Welcome to the **Fake Product Identification System**, an advanced solution designed to help users quickly and efficiently determine whether a product is genuine or counterfeit. This system leverages modern technologies, including image recognition, machine learning, and blockchain verification, to provide accurate results.


## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Uses advanced image processing and AI to detect key features of genuine and counterfeit products.
- **Blockchain Verification**: Ensures authenticity through secure product serial numbers and manufacturer records stored on a blockchain.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Notifies users instantly when counterfeit items are detected.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI that requires minimal effort to operate.
- **Extensive Database**: Cross-references a wide range of product categories and brands to ensure comprehensive identification.


## Installation

To get started with the Fake Product Identification System, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2020-shaw/fake-product-identification-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd fake-product-identification-system
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the system:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Upload a product image using the "Upload Image" button.
2. The system will process the image using machine learning algorithms to detect authenticity.
3. The result will display whether the product is genuine or counterfeit.
4. If desired, the system will cross-reference the product's serial number with the blockchain database for additional verification.

### API (Optional)

You can also interact with the system via API:

- **POST** `/api/verify`
  
  Example request body:

  ```json
  {
    "productImage": "image-data",
    "serialNumber": "XYZ123456"
  }
  ```
